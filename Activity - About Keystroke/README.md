## Activity - About Keystroke Injection Attack

Hackers commonly use a keystroke injection attack to execute malicious commands via a USB drive connected to a host computer. A Keystroke Injection Attack has been an issue for computer users for a long time, and it is problematic due to the affordability and availability of keystroke injection tools. With the use of a specially designed USB device (the Rubber Ducky), often disguised as a thumb drive, that automatically runs code on any host computer into which it is plugged. In this activity, you will implement a simple form of USB keystroke injection The Rubber Ducky uses a simple coding language called Ducky Script language, that when inserted into a computer, acts as a programmable keyboard executing a payload script that has been programmed into the device.
