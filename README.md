## What is Cyber Hygiene – 

Cyber hygiene is the practice of using computer systems and other technological devices to maintain computer system health, keep data safe and well-protected, and improve online security. This could involve a routine to ensure identity safety – such as always using different passwords for accounts or just a general awareness of potential threats while using technology. 
Having good cyber hygiene is important not only to maintain the health of your system to make sure it runs quickly and smoothly but also to protect it from nefarious means such as viruses, malware, and your personal privacy and data. Cyber hygiene is also important to the users to protect accounts from hackers and thieves from accessing your data, social media accounts, or other vital accounts such as banking. 

 ## Common Cyber Hygiene Problems 
 
•	Loss of data/misplaced data, not making regular backups of hard drives, or not utilising cloud storage could result in information being lost if the drive was to ever crash. 
•	Security breach, attacks from hackers through phishing, hacking, malware, spam, or viruses could cost loss of accounts or data. 
•	Out of date software, having out of date software of firewalls means they are not able to tackle newer attacks and exploits that were never patched out.
•	Other users of the data, everyone needs to utilise the same secure practices else data can be breached by one of the weaker members.
