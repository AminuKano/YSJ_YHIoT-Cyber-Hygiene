# YSJ_YHIoT-Cyber-Hygiene

Instructor Dr Aminu Usman 

The section will cover aspects of maintaining system health and improving understand of online security. This will include understanding keystroke injection attacks to execute payloads quickly into systems, attacking and monitoring keyboard inputs to observe keystrokes of a user and setting up and listening to transmissions send over a radio signal. Students would be required to have access to a computer system, internet connectivity, and access privilege to download and install applications during the session.

## What is Cyber Hygiene – 

Cyber hygiene is the practice of using computer systems and other technological devices to maintain computer system health, keep data safe and well-protected, and improve online security. This could involve a routine to ensure identity safety – such as always using different passwords for accounts or just a general awareness of potential threats while using technology. 
Having good cyber hygiene is important not only to maintain the health of your system to make sure it runs quickly and smoothly but also to protect it from nefarious means such as viruses, malware, and your personal privacy and data. Cyber hygiene is also important to the users to protect accounts from hackers and thieves from accessing your data, social media accounts, or other vital accounts such as banking. 

 ## Common Cyber Hygiene Problems 
 
*	Loss of data/misplaced data, not making regular backups of hard drives, or not utilising cloud storage could result in information being lost if the drive was to ever crash. 
*	Security breach, attacks from hackers through phishing, hacking, malware, spam, or viruses could cost loss of accounts or data. 
*	Out of date software, having out of date software of firewalls means they are not able to tackle newer attacks and exploits that were never patched out.
*	Other users of the data, everyone needs to utilise the same secure practices else data can be breached by one of the weaker members. 

## Good Practices for Cyber Hygiene 
* Keep software up to date, keeping software up to date means it is always ready to deal with the latest threats and any exploits will have been patched.
* Use secure passwords/password managers, not using common or easy to guess passwords means you’re less likely to be vulnerable to brute force attacks. Using password managers can allow for more complex passwords to be used.
*	Make regular backups of data, in the case of data being lost or corrupted it can always be recovered from a backup.
*	Update your software regularly - Update your apps n your cell phone or computers, web browsers, and operating systems regularly to ensure you are working with the latest programs. With time, software applications may have security patch or glitches that attackers can use to exploit your devices. With regular updates those vulnerable points can be eliminated.
* Limit users’ access, people should only be granted the access level they need for their work to be done and not any levels above in case they were ever compromised. 
* Avoid accessing public Wi-Fi.  Remember, whenever you connect your device to the Internet, you are at the mercy of the network owner. The person who owns the internet gateway can successfully filter your internet traffic and subsequently exploit your device through different forms of attacks such as ARP Poisoning attacks, DNS Spoofing attacks, SSL stripping attacks, etc.  If you must use Public Wi-Fi.
Remember any device could be at risk, be cautious — treat all Wi-Fi links with suspicion.

* Verify the wireless connection, do not just rely on names - Some bogus links — that have been set up by malicious users — will have a connection name that’s deliberately similar to the coffee shop, hotel or venue that’s offering free W - i-Fi.

* Use a VPN (virtual private network) - By using a VPN on Wi-Fi network, you’ll effectively be using a ‘private tunnel’ that encrypts all of your data that passes through the network.

* Avoid using specific types of websites – When using public Wi-Fi, it’s a good idea to avoid logging into websites where cybercriminals could capture your identity, passwords or personal information — such as social networking sites, online banking services or any websites that store your credit card information. If you need to access any websites that store or require the input of any sensitive information — including social networking, online shopping, and online banking sites — it may be worthwhile accessing them via your mobile phone network, instead of the public Wi-Fi connection.
